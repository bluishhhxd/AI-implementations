# AI Implementations

A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented **from scratch in Python**, with a strong focus on understanding the underlying mathematics and optimization methods.

## Contents
- **ML_from_scratch/**
  - Regression
    - Linear Regression
    - Multiple Linear Regression
    - Polynomial Regression
  - Classification
    - Logistic Regression  
      - Gradient Ascent optimization  
      - Newton–Raphson optimization (using exact Hessian and Gauss–Jordan elimination, no solvers)

## Highlights
- Implemented core ML algorithms without using high-level ML libraries
- Derived and coded gradients and Hessians manually
- Implemented Newton’s method by solving linear systems via Gauss–Jordan elimination (no matrix inversion or optimizers)
- Compared convergence behavior of Gradient Ascent vs Newton’s Method

## Goal
Build **deep, first-principles understanding** of machine learning by implementing algorithms and optimization techniques from scratch.
